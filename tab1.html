                I had a little bit more than 10 weeks to plan, design, develop, and revise this site. During the planning stage it took me a few days to really decide on a framework to use. I was interested in bootstrap but I also looked into others like ionic, react, etc. In the end I found bootstrap to be the quickest and easiest to pick up- so I built this site using bootstrap, a javascript, html framework with CSS. The web hosting and domain is from godaddy. This website has six pages, one home page, one about page, and four content pages. The main UI components I used were, containers, carousels, modals, infinite scroll,navbar, pagination, and buttons.             </div>

            <p style="height: 100px; color:#ffffff"> This screenshot was taken on july 12 so about a week or two after I started this project. I found out how to use the most basic starting template bootstrap provides to at least establish a grid structure to the site. This was also around the time when I didnâ€™t like BIF and wanted to change it to something less ominous. Obviously I failed. </p>
